                        <p>Incredibly aromatic and smooth, Copperglen Gin is handcrafted in small batches using fresh organic juniper and a blend of 10 additional botanicals.  One of the few gins that is smooth enough to be enjoyed straight, yet flavorful enough to be the base of your favorite gin-inspired cocktails.</p>

                <div class="story__description">
                    <div class="story__description__first">
                        <p>Inspired by their love of travel, a long-standing passion for fine spirits, and more than 25 years of commercial distillation experience, the founders of Copperglen Still Works decided to channel their passions and knowledge into a craft distilling business serving the local restaurants, bars, and markets in Kennett Square and its surrounding communities.  The name “Copperglen” conjures up the beautifully bucolic vistas of the owners’ southern Chester County home where the Big Elk Creek carves it’s way through the stunning tree line of the surrounding glen.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="story__description__second">
                        <p>The brand also pays homage to elemental copper; the material from which the finest distillation equipment used in craft spirit making has been forged for centuries.  The brand’s tree imagery – a variant of the Celtic Tree of Life – reflects both the owners’ Irish heritage and the Chester County surroundings which inspired the name.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            May the passion, experience and heritage captured in the Copperglen story shine through as you enjoy these truly original handcrafted spirits.  Sláinte!</p>
